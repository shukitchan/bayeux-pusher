# Bayeux Pusher

This is a commandline tool to send a message to a ![Bayeux 1.0](http://svn.cometd.com/trunk/bayeux/bayeux.html) compliant server. It can be a great tool to help test Bayeux server implementation as well.

Features
* Verbose mode to print out the HTTP requests sent and HTTP responses received
* Can do HANDSHAKE/CONNECT before sending the message. And then do the DISCONNECT request afterward. In this mode, you can control the message ID you use.
* Can skip HANDSHAKE/CONNECT/DISCONNECT completely and directly send the message to the server
* Support passing in authentication information as "ext" field in the HANDSHAKE request
* Support passing in authentication information through extra HTTP headers

You can run the tool with "-h" to see the help message
